# JavaScript Starter

Minimal JS skeleton project with a runnable plan-picker page.

## Quick start

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

`npm start` spins up a tiny static server on http://localhost:3000 and serves `home/index.html`.
Open that URL to interact with the plan-selection UI for setting up meter projects.

## Plan picker page

Open `home/index.html` in a browser to view the plan-selection UI for starting meter projects.

## Linting

ESLint is included. Run:

```bash
npm run lint
```
